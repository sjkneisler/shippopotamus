# Progress Report: Shippopotamus Pivot & Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-12
**Session**: Major pivot from internal tooling to consumer platform

## Summary

Successfully pivoted Shippopotamus from an internal PromptOps framework to a consumer-focused prompt management platform delivered via MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. The Pivot (Why We Changed Direction)

**Original Vision**: Internal tools for managing memory, task queues, and deduplication
- `prune_memory.py` - Memory pruning
- `progress_queue.py` - Task tracking
- `tool_dedup_guard.py` - Call deduplication

**Problem Identified**: These tools were solving *our* problems, not *consumer* problems. They were internal utilities that wouldn't provide value to external users installing an MCP.

**New Vision**: Professional prompt management platform
- Load curated, battle-tested prompts
- Save and version team-specific prompts
- Compose prompts intelligently
- Budget context usage

**Rationale**: This directly helps teams building AI applications - a real consumer need.

### 2. Implementation Choices

**FastMCP + Python**: Kept Python for core logic (familiar, works well)
**TypeScript Bridge**: Added Node.js MCP server wrapper for distribution
**Dual Registry**: Default prompts (our curation) + custom prompts (user saves)
**File References**: Allow pointing to existing docs without copying

### 3. Prompt Library Expansion

Added 4 new high-value prompts:
- `debugging_methodology` (🐛) - Systematic debugging
- `code_review` (👀) - Comprehensive checklist  
- `documentation` (📝) - Writing clear docs
- `testing_strategy` (🧪) - TDD approach

Total: 12 curated prompts across methodologies, patterns, and meta categories.

## What We Built

### Core Tools (6 total)
1. `get_prompt(name)` - Load from registry
2. `save_prompt(...)` - Save custom prompts
3. `load_prompts([...])` - Batch loading
4. `compose_prompts(...)` - Smart combination
5. `list_available()` - Discovery
6. `estimate_context(...)` - Token planning

### Architecture
```
tools/
├── prompt_registry.py    # Core registry (SQLite)
├── prompt_composer.py    # Composition tools
├── mcp_bridge.py        # Python ↔ TypeScript bridge
└── __init__.py

src/
├── index.ts             # MCP server implementation
└── cli.ts              # npx entry point
```

### Documentation Updates
- **CLAUDE.md** - Rewritten for new platform focus
- **README.md** - Consumer-oriented documentation
- **QUICKSTART.md** - Step-by-step tutorial
- **backlog.md** - New roadmap (versions 0.2-0.6)

## Testing & Validation

✅ All Python tests pass (10/10)
✅ MCP bridge tested and working
✅ TypeScript builds successfully
✅ Documentation updated throughout

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consumer Focus is Critical**: Always ask "who will use this and why?"
2. **Dogfooding Works**: Using our own tools to build better tools validated the design
3. **Simple > Complex**: Prompt management is more valuable than task queues
4. **Documentation Matters**: Had to rewrite everything after the pivot

## Next Steps

### Immediate (v0.1.0)
- [ ] Publish to npm registry
- [ ] Create demo video
- [ ] Announce in MCP community

### Short Term (v0.2.0)
- [ ] Prompt versioning
- [ ] Import/export functionality
- [ ] VS Code extension

### Long Term
- [ ] Web UI for prompt management
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Prompt marketplace

## Technical Debt

1. **Testing Gap**: Need integration tests for MCP protocol
2. **Error Handling**: MCP bridge could be more robust
3. **Performance**: Haven't tested with large prompt libraries
4. **Security**: Need to validate file paths more carefully

## Success Metrics

When we know we've succeeded:
- Teams adopt Shippopotamus for their AI projects
- Custom prompts outnumber default prompts 10:1
- Community contributes new prompt patterns
- "Shippopotamus" becomes synonymous with professional prompt management
