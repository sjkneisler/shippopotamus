This repo, **Shippopotamus** (or **🚢🦛Shippo** for short), captures cross‑project prompt assets so that any coding LLM can:

1. Load one tiny file (`00_INDEX.md`) every turn.  
2. Discover further guidance on‑demand via header search.  
3. Use **exactly three** Day‑0 tools that mitigate runaway context, progress loss, and duplicate calls.  

Why so small?  
*Large, always‑loaded prompts* waste context and hide stale guidance.  
*Many tools* cause choice overload and “tool‑drunk” loops.  
We start lean, measure pain, then promote backlog items (RAG‑registry, phase switch, etc.) only when justified.
